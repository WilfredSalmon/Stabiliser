# This currently doesnt work, because by the time this if-else statement is reached
# vpckg --install has already been run by the project() call, so the vcpkg triplet is already
# wrong. Unfortunately, it seems that the MSVC and MINGW flags are set by the project() call
# so that moving project() beneath this if-else statement means both branches are not run.
# As a workaround for MINGW, one can paste the MINGW branch above the project() command, and then
# compile once, causing vcpkg to install with the correct triplet. As long as the
# vcpkg_installed/x64-mingw-static folder is not subsequently deleted, or the vcpkg dependancies change,
# the additional set() commands can then be deleted - future builds will use the wrong triplet for vcpkg
# --install, but the correct installed folder already exists.
